    <p>Malayalam cinema, also referred to as Mollywood, is an Indian film industry of Malayalam-language motion
        pictures. It is based in Kerala, India. The films produced in Malayalam cinema are known for their
        cinematography and story-driven plots. In 1982, Elippathayam won the Sutherland Trophy at the London Film
        Festival, and Most Original Imaginative Film of 1982 by the British Film Institute. Rajiv Anchal's Guru (1997),
        Salim Ahamed's Adaminte Makan Abu (2011) and Lijo Jose Pellissery's Jallikkattu (2019) were Malayalam films sent
        by India as its official entries for the Best Foreign Language Film category at the Academy Awards.Other films
        which achieved global acclaim include Chemmeen (1965), which received a Certificate of Merit at the Chicago
        International Film Festival, and a gold medal at the Cannes Film Festival for Best Cinematography. Swaham (1994)
        won the Bronze Rosa Camuna at the Bergamo Film Meeting in Italy. The first 3D film produced in India, My Dear
        Kuttichathan (1984), was made in Malayalam. The first CinemaScope film produced in Malayalam was Thacholi Ambu
        (1978).[10]. During the early 1920s the Malayalam film industry was based in Thiruvananthapuram, although the
        film industry started to develop and flourish only by the late 1940s. Later the industry shifted to Chennai
        (formerly Madras), which then was the capital of the South Indian film industry. By the late 1980s, the
        Malayalam film industry returned and established itself in Kerala with the majority of locations, studios,
        production and post-production facilities being located in Kochi. Several media sources describe Kochi as the
        hub of the film industry. As of 2018, Malayalam cinema has got 14 awards for the best actor, 6 for the best
