        Hindi cinema, popularly known as Bollywood and formerly as Bombay cinema, refers to the film industry based
        in Mumbai, engaged in production of motion pictures in Hindi language. The popular term Bollywood, is a
        portmanteau of "Bombay" (former name of Mumbai) and "Hollywood". The industry is a part of the larger Indian
        cinema, which also includes South Cinema and other smaller film industries.In 2017, Indian cinema produced 1,986
        feature films, of which the largest number, 364 have been from Hindi.As per data from 2014, Hindi cinema
        represented 43 percent of Indian net box-office revenue; Tamil and Telugu cinema represented 36 percent, and the
        remaining regional cinema constituted 21 percent. Hindi cinema has overtaken the U.S. film industry to become
        the largest centre for film production in the world. In
        2001 ticket sales, Indian cinema (including Hindi films) reportedly sold an estimated 3.6 billion tickets
        worldwide, compared to Hollywood's 2.6 billion tickets sold Earlier Hindi films tended to use
        vernacular Hindustani, mutually intelligible by speakers of either Hindi or Urdu, while modern Hindi productions
        increasingly incorporate elements of Hinglish. The most popular commercial genre in Hindi cinema since the 1970s
        has been the masala film, which freely mixes
        different genres including action, comedy, romance, drama and melodrama along with musical numbers.
        Masala films generally fall under the musical film genre, of which Indian cinema has been the largest producer
        since the 1960s when it exceeded the American film industry's total musical output after musical films declined
        in the West; the first Indian musical talkie was Alam Ara (1931), several years after the first Hollywood
        musical talkie The Jazz Singer (1927). Alongside commercial masala films, a distinctive genre of art films known
        as parallel cinema has also existed, presenting realistic content and avoidance of musical numbers. In more
        recent years, the distinction between commercial masala and parallel cinema has been gradually blurring, with an
        increasing number of mainstream films adopting the conventions which were once strictly associated with parallel
        cinema.
